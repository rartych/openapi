      For 5G networks 3GPP Guaranteed Bit Rate (GBR) refers to a dedicated,
      fixed data rate assigned to

      specific services, ensuring a minimum performance level. As per 3GPP TS
      23.203,

      GBR is a QoS parameter used to manage traffic classes in mobile networks.
      It

      provides a stable data rate for latency-sensitive applications, such as
      voice calls or

      video streaming, helping maintain a consistent user experience. When this
      attribute is set

      this could imply that a GBR QCI is used, though mechanisms on the network
      can be used to

      ensure a minimum performance level without using a GBR QCI.

      defined in the

      DOCSIS 3.1 - MAC and Upper Layer Protocols Interface Specification"

      and it ensures a consistent level of performance for specific services
      within the network.

      the network to burst data at a higher rate than the maxDownstreamRate for
      a period of time.

      This can result in improved user experience when there is additional
      network capacity.

      For instance, when a user is streaming a video, the network can burst data
      at a higher rate

      to fill the buffer, and then return to the maxUpstreamRate once the buffer
      is full.

      NOTE: currently the duration within `sessionInfo` is limited to 86400

      The value of `maxDuration` shouldn't therefore exceed this time period.

      The packet delay budget is the maximum allowable one-way latency between

      the delay, the network

      can provide an acceptable level of performance for various services, such
      as voice calls,

      video streaming, and data.

  jitter:
    description: |
      The jitter requirement aims to limit the maximum variation in round-trip
      packet delay for the 99th percentile of traffic, following ITU Y.1540
      standards. It considers only acknowledged packets in a session, which are
      packets that receive a confirmation of receipt from the recipient (e.g.,
      using TCP). This requirement helps maintain consistent latency, essential
      for real-time applications such as VoIP, video calls, and gaming.

      The exponential power of the allowable error loss rate 10^(-N).

      For instance 3 would be an error loss rate of 10 to the power of -3
      (0.001)


      For 5G network the 3GPP specification TS 23.203 defines the packet error
      loss rate QCI attribute. It

      describes the Quality of Service (QoS) Class Identifier (QCI) parameters
      used to

      differentiate traffic classes in mobile networks, ensuring appropriate
      resource

      allocation and performance for various services.


      The packet error loss rate is one of the QCI attributes, providing
      information on the

      acceptable packet loss rate for a specific traffic class. This attribute
      helps maintain

      the desired performance level for services like voice calls, video
      streaming, or data

      transfers within the 3GPP mobile network.
