    If the notification callback is provided and the `qosStatus` of the session
    was `AVAILABLE` the client will receive in addition to the response a
    `QOS_STATUS_CHANGED` event with

    - `qosStatus` as `UNAVAILABLE` and

    - `statusInfo` as `DELETE_REQUESTED`

    There will be no notification event if the `qosStatus` was already
    `UNAVAILABLE`.
