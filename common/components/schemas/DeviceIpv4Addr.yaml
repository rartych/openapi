description: >
  The device should be identified by either the public (observed) IP address and
  port as seen by the application server, or the private (local) and any public
  (observed) IP addresses in use by the device (this information can be obtained
  by various means, for example from some DNS servers).


  If the allocated and observed IP addresses are the same (i.e. NAT is not in
  use) then  the same address should be specified for both publicAddress and
  privateAddress.


  If NAT64 is in use, the device should be identified by its publicAddress and
  publicPort, or separately by its allocated IPv6 address (field ipv6Address of
  the Device object)


  In all cases, publicAddress must be specified, along with at least one of
  either privateAddress or publicPort, dependent upon which is known. In
  general, mobile devices cannot be identified by their public IPv4 address
  alone.
