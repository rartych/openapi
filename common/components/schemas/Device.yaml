  End-user equipment able to connect to a mobile network. Examples of devices
  include smartphones or IoT sensors/actuators.
      The developer can choose to provide the below specified device identifiers:
      * `ipv4Address`
      * `ipv6Address`
      * `phoneNumber`
      * `networkAccessIdentifier`
      NOTE: the MNO might support only a subset of these options. The API invoker can provide multiple identifiers to be compatible across different MNOs. In this case the identifiers MUST belong to the same device.
